const KFACTOR = 22; // normally 32, but chosen 22 for a more conservative approach and the goal difference is added to K-factor.

This increased value means that a playerâ€™s rating will have a smaller impact on their expected score. https://towardsdatascience.com/developing-an-elo-based-data-driven-ranking-system-for-2v2-multiplayer-games-7689f7d42a53
